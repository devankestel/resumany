Dupont Performance Coatings
                                             (Now Axalta Coatings Systems)
Senior Chemical Engineer
February 2011 - April 2015

  * Product formulation, optimization, and technical support of solventborne and waterborne automotive coatings for General Motors accounts with revenue exceeding $30MM annually.
  * Optimized, commercialized, and launched a two­-component, polyurethane clearcoat system which delivered $800M revenue growth in 2012.
  * Developed new rheology test method with optimized shear profile, reducing error in measurement by 50%, for non­-Newtonian solventborne paint systems.
  * Technical lead for innovative spray process and paint technology conversion program which minimized assembly line downtime by 50% over conventional conversion.
  * Provided support to Arlington Assembly, GM's most profitable manufacturing site, via new color development, formulation adjustments, and troubleshooting line issues (2011-2013). Currently provide support to Bowling Green Assembly, home of the Corvette.
  * In addition to research and development, interface with manufacturing, quality assurance, sales and marketing, product stewardship, and field account teams on a daily basis.
  * Work in a high­pressured, multi­tasking environment with constantly changing priorities and frequently required to make "on the spot" decisions that directly impact manufacturing at both Axalta and GM sites.
  * Align formulas, manufacturing procedures, and product design specifications for manufacturing scale­-up.

University of Notre Dame du Lac
Graduate Research Assistant
October 2007 - March 2010

  * Thermophysical property measurement and estimation of ionic liquid systems for use as environmentally benign working fluids for carbon dioxide capture.
  * Worked in a hybrid experimental and computational team to rapidly screen and characterize candidate ionic liquids for process optima including: relative volatility and solubility, hydrophobicity, corrosivity, toxicity, reaction and absorption enthalpies, and others properties relevant to process scale­up.
  * Analyzed and calculated hysteresis, infinite dilution activity coefficients, Henry's Law constants, and deconvolution of physical CO2 solubility from chemical CO2 reaction in amine­-functionalized ionic liquid systems.
  * Supervised design and construction of ionic liquid absorber/ stripper unit.
  * Proficient with both high and low pressure systems.

Alltech, Inc.
Chemical Engineering Intern
June 2004 - August 2006

  * Product development, process design, and pilot plant management for Optigen, a controlled­-release, non­protein nitrogen supplement for dairy cattle which is now commercialized.
  * Authored process flow diagrams. Collaborated on design of specialized fluidized bed dryer. Designated process instrumentation for final scale­up.





  * Ruby, Rails, JS, HTML5, CSS3, MATLAB, C++, Python
  * Here is where I talk about all the fancy Codeschool courses I took and badges I earned. In paragraph format. So this has to be long like sentences and stuff. There you go.
  * Certified Beer Server, RABSQA Lead Internal Quality Auditor, Six Sigma Greenbelt
  * Here is where I blather about my fancy study abroad in Madrid that lasted six months where I took lots of courses and did lots of things. Fluency in a foreign language is cool and should count for something.
