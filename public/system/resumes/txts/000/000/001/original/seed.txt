This is a sample file. 
It will be used along with seeded data for intial app testing. 
In the final app, this file will contain a resume, generated from the user inputed data.

I'm adding some other filler text here. 

And here.

And even more right here. 

Clearly writing all of this random text qualifies me for a job, and I don't really need a full resume.
Maybe I should just stop programming right now?
